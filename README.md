## 🌟 Overview

**HepatoScope** is a comprehensive diagnostic support platform designed for healthcare professionals. Inspired by top-tier medical software, it provides **Doctors** with non-invasive, AI-driven insights from patient Liver Function Tests (LFTs), and presents **Patients** with an easy-to-understand portal tracking their hepatic health trends securely.

The application computes mathematical severity formulas natively and synthesizes medical language utilizing on-demand Large Language Models (LLMs)—generating a beautifully tailored report entirely exportable to physical PDF prescriptions.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🛡️ Secure Closed-Loop Identity
- **Three-Tier Architecture:** Admin, Doctor, and Patient roles, tightly controlled with Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS).
- **Admin Governance:** Patients cannot register themselves. Only validated Administrators can onboard doctors and assign patients under their care.

### 🧠 Real-Time Clinical Analysis Engine
- **Live Risk Preview:** As a doctor inputs LFT biomarkers (Total Bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, Albumin), an analytic grid actively recalculates a deterministic risk multiplier (Low, Moderate, High, Critical) using standard clinical bounds.
- **AI Synthesis (Ollama):** At the click of a button, the system bundles the biometric data and risk factors to a secure local Ollama AI model (e.g., Llama3/Mistral), which outputs a polished, professional medical summary without sending patient data to public tech networks.

### 🎨 Premium Visual Identity
- **Glassmorphism & Micro-animations:** Framer Motion-powered page transitions, skeleton loaders, and interactive card hovers.
- **Data Visualization:** Actionable KPIs built dynamically with customized Recharts plotting historical patient trends over time.
- **Export Control:** Deep integration to parse and render native standard prescriptions via single-click PDF downloads.

## 👨‍⚕️ User Roles & Views

- **Administrator (`/admin`)**: Manages the platform, creates new doctor and patient accounts, and matches them. Displays a global statistical view of the hospital systems total reports.
- **Doctor (`/doctor`)**: Views assigned patients, manages LFT reports through interactive Dual-Panel analysis forms, commands the AI engine, sets follow-ups, and downloads dynamic PDFs.
- **Patient (`/patient`)**: Minimalist interface. Tracks past reports, views real-time diagnostic risk graphs, and downloads prescription advice uploaded by their assigned doctors.
